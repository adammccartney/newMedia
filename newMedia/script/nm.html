This course is an introduction to media theory – a subcategory of
philosophy that emerged in the mid 20th century as an attempt to
understand the impact that new technologies were having on the
individual and, in a broader sense, society.
The general tone used to convey the ideas contained throughout the
notes and lectures will be an informal one, you refers to you the
reader, listener and student. We refers to the teachers, authors and
students that have been consulted in developing the material for this
course. Us refers to the group that we happen to find ourselves in at
any particular moment in time. And I refers to me, the teacher, Adam McCartney.
This course is intended to introduce undergraduate level music
students to the broader disciplines relevant for professional work in
the arts and humanities. There are those who would consider it absurd
that now, in the 21st century, investing in anything but a science
related degree is simply a waste. In the face of such beliefs, it is
worth pausing briefly to remember a simple point made by John Henry
Newman, that a solid education in the liberal arts equips a student
with tools that will ultimately lead them to become better engineers,
scientists, doctors, artists, lawyers and etc.

The satisfaction that can be gained through learning, teaching and
generally sharing information and can be immense. My more positive
experiences over the years as a student and teacher have tended to
come from courses, books, tutorials, videos, discussions that were
clear enough to allow enable an understanding of the topic from
first principles – that is to say that the material related to
the topic was assembled in such a way as to reveal its most
fundamental ideas. Its virtually always beneficial to ask rudimentary
questions about whatever it is that we are trying to understand, as
such questions will quickly reveal whether or not the topic under
discussion has a basis in fact.
This course also aims to introduce some of the core methods that are
useful anywhere that it becomes necessary to think about something:

The primary source of information for topics presented in this course
can be found in the VMI digital library, which is labelled <i>Academic
Resources For Students</i> and will appear as a link on the homepage of
your Moodle eLearning profile.
Please take the time to do the readings, this will prepare you for the
discussions that will take place during class. Thinking about things
is a practical exercise, it‘s the same as riding a bicycle or learning
to play an instrument. That means that the only way that you are going
to learn how to think is by engaging with the readings and
exercises. Much the same as any activity that is worth learning,
thinking is difficult and takes a lot of patience to get right.
The texts that were chosen to be part of the course are all written in
an accessible style and are not overtly academic or
technical. Nevertheless, they do contain  ideas and arguments that you
might not get on the first reading.  My two favorite reading
disciplines  from when I was an undergraduate were the practice of
reading for a pre-allocated amount of time and also reading each text
at least three times in preparation for a class.

Should you try and tell your piano tuner about Ludwig Wittgenstein‘s
ideas on the formation of knowledge? Definitely not! In fact, they
would be more likely to charge you extra fees just to get your piano
tuned if you chose to do so.
So where exactly can this knowledge be applied? A friend of mine is a
hobby programmer and he recently told me his principle approach to
work. He called it „eat your own dogfood“. Now obviously the idea of
eating any kind of dogfood does not sound particularly appetizing, but
it is worth considering that dogs can also eat cake. The simple idea
here is that whatever type of idea or discipline you develop, it is
better first practiced on yourself before inflicting it upon the rest
of us; when properly cultivated a discipline is a way to nourish,
develop and sustain.

<p>
The renaissance had shown that the rise of merchant classes was
possible, and that there was room for a talented craftspeople to build
a career out of a good reputation. Still, even the most talented
artists from the renaissance and baroque periods were subjects of
some royal court and often patronized (though less commonly so than in
the middle ages and early renaissance) by the clergy. The dominant
motives of these eras were, for instance, dedicated to the nobility
and to the church. An appreciation for human ingenuity was growing and
quietly, a new philosophy of reason and enlightenment was being born.

Before it turned into a bloody mess, the core ideals of the French
Revolution (freedom, equality and brotherhood) seemed to be an
articulation of the broader hopes of humanity for a brighter future.
Many of the artists of the late 18th and early 19th centuries echoed
these newly formed ideas of the enlightenment.

Much of the art of the age focused Utopian ideals, be they either in
some possible future or some glorified past: there were large
collections of folk tales, songs and verses that emerged during this
period that bore testament to the vision of "the folk" as being
inherently virtuous. The new movements toward industrialized living
and a faster pace of life, on the other hand, was often viewed with at
least the usual amount of suspicion. Of course, the of a fall from
grace and the quest for redemption is literally as old as Adam and Eve.

<h3 id="org35acb78">Critical Theory</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org35acb78">
<p>
Reference: <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/critical-theory/">https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/critical-theory/</a>
</p>

<p>
In the narrow sense, critical theory refers to a strain of Marxist
philosophy that appeared in early 20th century Germany. It is critical
in the sense that it seeks human "emancipation from slavery", acts as
a "liberating &#x2026; influence", and works to "create a world which
satisfies the needs and powers" of human beings (Horkheimer 1972, 246)
</p>

<p>
Key figures of "the Frankfurt School": Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno,
Marcuse, Benjamin
</p>

<p>
Being a strain of Marxist philosophy, central to critical theory is a
critique of Capitalism. Furthermore, a strong emphasis is placed on a
belief that civil society and human culture in general is undergoing a
process of degeneration due to the commodification of artistic
production and aesthetic experience.
</p>

<p>
It could be argued that much of critical theory is based on a
revivification of an aspect of Kant's categorical imperative: namely,
that one should avoid using people (including oneself) as a means to
an end. A critical theorist such as Adorno might argue that
contemporary pop that has been used in the service of some form of
advertising, is ultimately less moral and therefor less good or
effective than say, Beethoven's 7th symphony. (Adorno <i>really</i> liked
Beethoven and was big into the idea of "absolute" music).
</p>

<p>
By the same reasoning, one could argue that the whole discipline of
Critical Theory is morally corrupt due to the simple fact that it
essentially seeks to hi-jack and politicize branches of philosophy
such as aesthetics (which are by no means inherently political).

Notes on reading: <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dewey-aesthetics/">https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dewey-aesthetics/</a>
</p>

<p>
First couple of points to note relate to the historical evolution of
aesthetics. With the rise of nationalism and imperialism, art became
disassociated from religious right and with the growing dominance of
capitalism, became more about documenting material wealth than
integrating personal with collective experience.
</p>

<p>
This idea of the quality of experience is seemingly central to Dewey's
aesthetics. It follows quite logically that experience happens
essentially in conjunction with the environment and not just <i>in</i>
it. Whether or not life experience can be reduced solely to the basis
of needs and conquest, is not so clear. I do not think that it is self
evident that all conflict and resolution arises from the frustration
or gratification of basic physical or physio-psychological urges.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, it is possible to imagine how Dewey might try to
structure his thought at this stage as he suggests that harmony and
equilibrium arise from the resolution of tension. Awareness of this
process, the rhythmic alteration between states of unity and disunity
signifies conscious participation in the phenomenon of experience.
</p>

<p>
Dewey seems to suggest here that emotions are breaks in experience,
something to be understood in retrospect. More specifically he refers
to emotions as signifiers that disrupt experience. This does make some
sense, as the presence of an emotion seems, quite certainly, to
require a level of abstraction that seems to move the subject into an
acute awareness of the distinct mode, through which he now views experience.
</p>

<p>
He sets up an interesting comparison between scientist and artist,
shows that both are trying to shape material according to their thought processes.
</p>

<p>
He points out that nature already has emotional qualities. That some
aspects may appear comforting or disturbing.
</p>

<p>
Aesthetic experience then involves a temporal process where action,
feeling and meaning are one.  The cumulative effect of these on one
another is balance. This is only possible, in a dynamic world, where
experience takes place.
</p>

<p>
Passing out of disturbance into harmony can provide man's most intense
experience. Happiness is the result of a deep fulfillment in which our
whole being has adjusted to the environment. This seems to directly
contradict what he says above about emotion, although on a more subtle
level he seems to be suggesting something closer to integration here
than happiness. Personally, I would place the core of aesthetics at integration.

<h4 id="orgbfbbc23">Emotions</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgbfbbc23">
<p>
The previous section suggests that aesthetics is essentially an act of
integration. The experience of this act, ultimately leads to an
emotional experience. Emotions are not static, they posses dynamic
qualities and can grow or shrink over time.

<h4 id="orgc2b3aad">Early Influence</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgc2b3aad">
<p>
At Cambridge (entering in 1934) he studied under the professors I.A. Richards and
F.R. Leavis.
</p>

<p>
It's worth considering that there were some pretty incredible advances
taking place in the fields of Mathematics and Physics (both
theoretical and applied) during the first half of the 20th century.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead had published "Principia
Mathematica", both of whom held professorships in mathematics at Cambridge</li>
<li>Ludwig Wittgenstein started a fellowship at the University in 1929</li>
<li>Alan Turing studied there as an undergrad from 1931 to 1934 and was
elected a fellow of King's College in 1935 (at age 22) after his
dissertation offering a proof of central limit theorem was well
received</li>
</ul>

<p>
Besides the obvious name dropping, the purpose of pointing out these
figures is to emphasize that there was a lot of "technical" academic
work happening at Cambridge during this time. In particular, Russell &amp;
Whiteheads work on finding a formal description of mathematics saw the
development of specialist notation.
</p>

<p>
In an attempt to keep up with these advances, fields more
traditionally rooted in the humanities, themselves began to embody the
new practices of logic and formalism as they emerged from mathematics,
physics and early computational theory.
</p>

<p>
It seems that I.A. Richards was particularly interested in forming a
new, multidisciplinary approach to literary criticism that could give
formalist, self-contained and objective accounts of what was being
said in any literary work. It appears that to some degree, Richards
was trying to incorporate cybernetics into his theories on literary
criticism.
</p>

<p>
Thinking about the human mind as one part of a cybernetic system, was
an idea that influenced McLuhan profoundly, and research in and around
this idea became a central part of his work throughout the rest of his
career.

<i>"Water is unknown to a fish until it discovers air"</i>
</p>

<p>
In "The Gutenberg Galaxy" McLuhan presents a dazzling array of ideas,
that often closely focus on the multi-sensory (or multi-dimensional)
context of literary ideas. For instance, he writes about Shakespeare's
use of perspective in King Lear, pointing out that it may be the first
time that a writer has employed the use of a three-dimensional first
person perspective on a scene within the context of a literary
work. For McLuhan, the interesting point here is that the written word
seems to been reaching out beyond the page, and evoking our other
senses to aid our perception of the scene.
</p>

<p>
Print is an extension of writing, which itself is an extension of
speaking and in turn thinking. The process is inherently circular,
a new technology emerges to form a super set of the technology that
immediately preceded it.
</p>

<p>
For McLuhan, technology is always an extension of the mind (the
cognitive/sensory apparatus) and therefor it influences the formation
of ideas.

The next couple of sections serve to offer a very brief overview of the history of computing. Although computers are ubiquitous and a thorough discussion of the history of their development might be of more interest to those with a more technical interest, the culture around computing is actually pretty interesting. We've been talking a lot over the past couple of lectures about some of the sociological developments that have taken place over the past 150-200 years. We've focused on the artist and the means of production used to make art. Also, we've asked some fairly general questions about how the context within which art is made (or taught) influences the production. The purpose of this rather long-winded exposition is to spend some time reasoning about our current environment. The better that we are able to perceive the situation, the more likely it is we will reach for the right tool when it comes time to do the work.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga4477bd">
<p>
Unix is a simple operating system that was born in 1969, invented by Ken Thompson at Bell Laboratories (a research branch of AT&amp;T). This is not really the place to go into a detailed history of how it developed, if you are interested, check out Brian Kernighan's writings on the subject, along with Eric S. Raymond and Mike Loukides. All will offer a slightly different perspective on the origins of Unix and how it has developed over the years.
</p>

<p>
There are some diverging opinions on why Unix has been successful as an operating system. It's not uncommon to hear people speaking in hushed tones about free software and the open source movement as reasons for its longevity and success. Others will put it down to factors associated with the nature of the computer hardware business in the 1980s. Either case is not particularly important to understand for our purposes. What is important is that there seems to be some consensus around how its use in Universities and research environments ultimately contributed to its popularity. The point here being, that the University is still one of the rare places where a more open-ended form of creativity is encouraged. Unix suits researchers because it is accessible, easy to use and fun to hack.
